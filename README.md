# Bank Management System Documentation
## Overview
This repository contains all the essential documentation, requirements, use cases, and UML diagrams for the development of a Bank Management System. The goal of this system is to streamline banking operations, improve customer experiences, and ensure secure and efficient management of bank services.

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized into three main folders to efficiently manage the various documentation and materials related to the Bank Management System project:

### 1. **`diagrams/`**  
This folder contains the **Use Case Diagram** and **Activity Diagrams** for the system:

- **Use Case Diagram**: This diagram illustrates the interactions between different actors (e.g., customers, bank employees, administrators) and the system. They provide a high-level overview of the system’s functionality and how users interact with it.
- **Activity Diagrams**: These diagrams represent the workflows and processes within the system. They visually map out the steps involved in key operations and business processes.

### 2. **`documentation/`**  
This folder contains the **documentation file** for the project:

- **Documentation File**: This document includes the **system requirements** (functional and non-functional) and **use case tables**. The requirements outline what the system must do and how it should perform. The use case tables provide structured descriptions of the system’s functionality, listing the actors, main flows, and alternative flows for each use case.

### 3. **`reports/`**  
This folder contains the **weekly meeting reports** documenting the progress and discussions held during team meetings:

- **Weekly Meeting Reports**: These reports summarize the topics discussed, decisions made, and tasks assigned during each weekly meeting.
